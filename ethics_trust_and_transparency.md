MEDIUM ARCILE: Ethics for Artificial Intelligence
https://medium.com/design-ibm/everyday-ethics-for-artificial-intelligence-75e173a9d8e8
Everyday Ethics for Artificial Intelligence is a framework for AI ethics that you and your team can immediately put into practice. We partnered with Francesca Rossi, IBM’s global leader for AI ethics, to distill a variety of information and perspectives into a digestible and actionable guide for designers and developers.

1. Accountability: AI designers and developers are responsible for considering AI design, development, decision processes, and outcomes.
2. Value Alignment: AI should be designed with consideration of the norms and values of your user group.
3. Explainability: AI should be designed for humans to easily perceive, detect, and understand its decision process.
4. User Data Rights: AI should be designed to protect user data and preserve the user’s power over access and uses.
5. Fairness: AI should be designed to minimize bias and promote inclusive representation.
